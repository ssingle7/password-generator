# Password Generator 

The project password generator was designed to create an application that an employee could use to generate their own personal password. The objective was for this design to produce a random password based on criteria selected for the user to choose from. By applying different Javascript principles, the user will be able to establish a password based on their input to the selected prompts. 

-Created variables that would target that values that could inter change the values such as upper or lower case letters, numeric values, and the special characters. 

-Prompts were added to ask the user which variables they would like to have inputted into their random password. 

-Conditional statements were added so if the user chose one prompt over the other they could achieve the same result of a password chosen at random. 

-A for loop was integrated to ensure that any of the intended characters could be selected given the specific criteria. 

-A function was incorporated to ensure the return of a generated password. 

-An addEventListener method was also added to ensure once the user selected the generate password, the user could follow the prompt to yield the outcome of a random password.
